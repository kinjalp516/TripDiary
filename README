BUILDING:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to run our application, you should start by installing all
of the required dependencies listed in package.json. You can do this
by running the following command in terminal:

> npm install

Once your dependencies are installed, we can start our project with
relative easy by using the following predefined script:

> npm start

This script asks expo to initalize it's bundler service, which should
open it's web portal in your browser. From this web portal, expo provides
logs for our application along with the option to open the app on 
various platforms. Since we have focused our efforts on creating a moble
friendly user interface, please only select either the iOS emulator or
Android emulator.

If you'd like to run this application on your physical device, simply
download the expo client from the Google Play Store or the Apple App store
and scan the barcode that's present on the expo web portal.

Additionally, in order to execute any backend operations, our firebase project
configuration files are included as part of this repo, and this allows you to
run the application yourself without having to create a new firebase project.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CODE STRUCTURE:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The business logic for our application is built entirely into the
front-end piece of our application. We make use of react-native and
expo's tools (https://expo.io) to ease packaging of our application.

Our code is structured in an MVC approach such that we have a top level
app controller which serves as our access control layer. This controller
exists in the root of our codebase in the file App.js, and loads the three
main pages of our application - (1) the loading page, (2) the login page,
and (3) the My Trip page.

It starts off by directing the user to the loading page (LoadingPage.js)
on app startup. This file renders a progress indicator while it attempts
to authenticate the user if the user has previously logged in. If it finds
that the user has been authenticated, it redirects itself to the My Trips
Page (trips/TripsController.js), otherwise, it redirects to the Login Page
(LoginPage.js). 

You'll find that while Login and Loading are in the root directory, that
the My Trips Page exists within it's own trips/ directory. This is because
unlike Login and Loading, the trips controller needs it's own model and views
as it's a more complex component of our application. Following the layered
approach offered by the MVC model, we were able to use the model directory
to store our trip class definitions of the Trip object along with our database
calls which help us fetch the data. The trips/views/ directory holds the
different views of the My Trips page, which are called from root level
navigation that is set up within trips/TripsController.js

As you explore the rest of the application, you'll find that we have the
following directories which employ a similar approach in creating their 
independent views, models, and controller for each subfeature of our app
and they are all tied together through the controllers which ensure that
navigation is being handed off appropriately as the user uses different
parts of our application.
